# EVTC LogParser

## About

This program is parser ` .evtc ` raid logs. Upon the first time running, the following folders will be created ` /logs/ `, ` /graphs/ `, and ` /tables/ `. The ` /logs/ ` folder is where you put the ` .evtc ` files you are interested in parsing.

## Running

The Java program is a console application and needs to be ran with ` java.exe ` and ` JRE 1.8 `. By default. double-clicking a ` .jar ` file will instead run the program with ` javaw.exe `, resulting in the program not running. To circumvent this run the program either in the command line or using the supplied ` .bat `.
