# EVTC LogParser

## About

This program is a parser for ` .evtc ` raid logs in GW@. Upon its first time runningc (and if the folders do not exist), the following folders will be created ` /logs/ `, ` /graphs/ `, and ` /tables/ `. The ` /logs/ ` folder is where you put the ` .evtc ` files you are interested in parsing. Both ` /graphs/ ` and ` /tables/ ` are output folders.

## Running

The Java program is a console application and needs to be ran with ` java.exe ` and ` JRE 1.8 `. By default. double-clicking a ` .jar ` file will instead run the program with ` javaw.exe `, resulting in the program not running. To circumvent this run the program either in the command line or using the supplied ` .bat `.

## Options

The parse has the following options: \n

1. Final DPS
..* Displays DPS for each player
..* Displayers Total Damage for each player
2. Phase DPS
